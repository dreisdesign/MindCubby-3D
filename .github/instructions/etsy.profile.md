**Delightfully Engineered 3D Design: Form, Function, Fun**

## Shop Headline (About Section)
**I design and engineer functional 3D art that is precise, modular, and delightfully fun to use.**

## About Story
I spent over 12 years as a professional designer, focused on making complex systems intuitive and usable for everyone. I approach every 3D piece with this same mindset—applying a knack for organization and architecture to physical objects.

I love the challenge of engineering **clever mechanisms** and specialize in creating functional art **that is modular and robust**. This systematic approach ensures all my pieces—from the Custom Gingerbread Man to the Melting Ice Cream Cone—are scalable, consistent, and precisely built. I draw on my experience developing large-scale digital design systems (like the Smoothie Design System) to ensure my physical products are just as reliable.

My passion is creating objects that "just make sense" to people. My inspiration often comes from the intricate details found in vintage and antique mechanical products, reimagining that old-world ingenuity with modern precision.
