# Changelog

All changes to the MINDCUBBY-3D repository.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-13

### Documentation Consolidation 📚
Streamlined documentation structure for better navigation and maintainability.

#### Changes
- **Consolidated 6 files** into 2 focused documents (759 lines removed, 36% reduction)
  - Removed: `WORKFLOW.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `PRINTER_SPECS.md`, `CURA_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT.md`, `MULTI_MATERIAL_SETUP.md`, `MILESTONE_1.md`
  - Created: `DOCUMENTATION/SETUP.md` (hardware, materials, profiles, troubleshooting)
  - Created: `DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCE.md` (commands, workflows, tips, benchmarks, FAQ)
  
- **Updated Navigation** in README.md
  - Quick Links: 3 documentation links → 2 consolidated links
  - Directory structure: reflects new doc organization
  
#### Benefits
- Easier to find information (2 focused files vs 6 overlapping files)
- Reduced documentation maintenance burden
- Better cross-referencing between setup and reference topics
- Cleaner repository structure

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-12

### Complete Automation System ⚡
Major release with comprehensive automation for print-to-Printables workflow.

#### Features
- **Automated Spec Generation** - Extract weight, time, temps from G-code
  - Parses nozzle/bed temperature from G-code comments
  - Calculates filament weight (1.25g per meter standard)
  - Extracts print time from `;TIME:` metadata
  - Generates markdown tables ready for Printables
  
- **Smart Change Detection** - Only regenerate changed files
  - Compares `.gcode` vs `_printables-description.md` modification times
  - Skip unchanged files (47 files in ~1 sec if all unchanged)
  - Reduces redundant processing
  
- **Git Integration** - Auto-generate specs on commit
  - Pre-commit hooks trigger spec generation
  - Updated files auto-staged before commit
  - Transparent to user workflow
  
- **Interactive CLI Menu** - Beautiful terminal UI
  - 8 options for common tasks
  - Arrow key navigation
  - Real-time git integration
  - One-command workflows

#### Commands
- `npm run menu` - Interactive CLI menu
- `npm run p` - Quick spec generation (PRINTABLES folder)
- `npm run specs [dir]` - Generate specs for directory  
- `gcode-commit "msg"` - One-line commit with auto specs
- `npm run commit` - Alternative commit method

#### Files Added
- `DOCUMENTATION/WORKFLOW.md` - Complete automation guide
- `scripts/gcode_specs.py` - Enhanced with weight/time extraction
- `scripts/menu.js` - Interactive CLI with arrow navigation
- `scripts/gcode-commit.sh` - Quick commit helper
- `.githooks/pre-commit` - Auto-generation hook

#### Files Updated
- `README.md` - New quick start and automation focus
- `.gitignore` - Track `.md`, `.3mf`, `.stl` specs and models
- `package.json` - New npm scripts and dependencies

#### Repository Cleanup
- Removed 31 media files from tracking (images, videos, PDFs)
- Removed old `.txt` spec files (replaced with `.md`)
- Final tracked files: 218 (down from 249)

### Tracked File Types (Final)
- **72 Markdown** - `*_printables-description.md` spec tables  
- **91 3D Models** - `.stl` source files
- **21 Cura Projects** - `.3mf` files with settings
- **8 G-Code** - Start/end code templates
- **3 Cura Profiles** - `.curaprofile` configurations

### Example Output
```
## Print Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Nozzle Temperature | 195°C |
| Bed Temperature | 65°C |
| Layer Height | 0.20 mm |
| Filament Weight | 3.9 g |
| Filament Length | 3.09 m |
| Estimated Print Time | 1h 33m 54s |
```

### Documentation

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- `CURA-SETTINGS/variants/Optimized_StartGCode_v6.gcode` — New start G-code variant that lowers the initial Z used for priming/skirt (0.15 mm) to improve first-layer adhesion when prints otherwise require a manual Z-offset adjustment after the skirt.

### Notes
- This change is non-destructive to the baseline files. Use `Ender3V2_Baseline_StartGCode.gcode` for rollback. If you have a probe, consider enabling mesh leveling (G29) or using a saved mesh (M420 S1) before priming.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-10

### Changed
- Reorganized `CURA-SETTINGS/` into `active/`, `variants/`, and `archived/` to make it easier to find the currently used start/end code, optimized variants, and historical archives. Updated docs to reference `CURA-SETTINGS/active/START_GCODE.txt` as the active start file.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- `CURA-SETTINGS/active/START_GCODE.txt`: Moved priming off-print (corner/back-edge purge) and added a retract → lift → wipe → micro-prime sequence to prevent nozzle blobs being picked up and dragged across the first layer. This reduces first-layer failures caused by deposited blobs during skirt/priming.

### Files
- `CURA-SETTINGS/active/START_GCODE.txt` — updated priming sequence
- `DOCUMENTATION/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — documented the off-print purge and added verification steps
