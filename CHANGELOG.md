### Documentation Consolidation 📚
Streamlined documentation structure for better navigation and maintainability.

#### Changes
- **Consolidated 6 files** into 2 focused documents (759 lines removed, 36% reduction)
  - Removed: `WORKFLOW.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `PRINTER_SPECS.md`, `CURA_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT.md`, `MULTI_MATERIAL_SETUP.md`, `MILESTONE_1.md`
  - Created: `DOCUMENTATION/SETUP.md` (hardware, materials, profiles, troubleshooting)
  - Created: `DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCE.md` (commands, workflows, tips, benchmarks, FAQ)
  
- **Updated Navigation** in README.md
  - Quick Links: 3 documentation links → 2 consolidated links
  - Directory structure: reflects new doc organization
  
#### Benefits
- Easier to find information (2 focused files vs 6 overlapping files)
- Reduced documentation maintenance burden
- Better cross-referencing between setup and reference topics
- Cleaner repository structure

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- `CURA-SETTINGS/variants/Optimized_StartGCode_v6.gcode` — New start G-code variant that lowers the initial Z used for priming/skirt (0.15 mm) to improve first-layer adhesion when prints otherwise require a manual Z-offset adjustment after the skirt.

### Notes
- This change is non-destructive to the baseline files. Use `Ender3V2_Baseline_StartGCode.gcode` for rollback. If you have a probe, consider enabling mesh leveling (G29) or using a saved mesh (M420 S1) before priming.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-10

### Changed
- Reorganized `CURA-SETTINGS/` into `active/`, `variants/`, and `archived/` to make it easier to find the currently used start/end code, optimized variants, and historical archives. Updated docs to reference `CURA-SETTINGS/active/START_GCODE.txt` as the active start file.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- `CURA-SETTINGS/active/START_GCODE.txt`: Moved priming off-print (corner/back-edge purge) and added a retract → lift → wipe → micro-prime sequence to prevent nozzle blobs being picked up and dragged across the first layer. This reduces first-layer failures caused by deposited blobs during skirt/priming.

### Files
- `CURA-SETTINGS/active/START_GCODE.txt` — updated priming sequence
- `DOCUMENTATION/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — documented the off-print purge and added verification steps
