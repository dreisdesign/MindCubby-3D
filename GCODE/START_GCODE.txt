; Minimal factory-style start G-code
; Purpose: simple, reliable boot sequence without priming/wipe logic
;   - Sets temps via Cura variables
;   - Homes axes
;   - Waits for bed and nozzle (safe blocking waits)
;   - Resets extruder and lifts Z to printing height

M104 S{material_print_temperature} ; Set nozzle temp (non-blocking)
M140 S{material_bed_temperature}    ; Set bed temp (non-blocking)

G28                                ; Home all axes
M190 S{material_bed_temperature}   ; Wait for bed to reach temp
M109 S{material_print_temperature} ; Wait for nozzle to reach temp

G92 E0 ; Reset extruder
G1 Z2.0 F3000 ; Lift to safe height and begin

; Note: This start sequence intentionally avoids priming/wiping.
; If needed, use Cura's skirt/brim settings to prime the nozzle during the first layer.
; Front-edge purge: deposit a line from front-left corner to front-right to prime nozzle
G1 X5 Y5 Z0.3 F9000.0 ; Move to front-left corner (travel speed increased to 150 mm/s)
G1 E0.2 F2400 ; Small initial prime
G1 X200 Y5 Z0.3 F1500.0 E6 ; Purge line across front edge to lay filament down (reduced)
G4 P150 ; Short dwell to let purge bead set on the bed
G92 E0 ; Reset extruder after purge so skirt starts with E=0
