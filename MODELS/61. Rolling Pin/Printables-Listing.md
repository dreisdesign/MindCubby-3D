## Quick Facts

* **Design:** **Three-part modular assembly**—handles snap into dowel, dowel supports the roller. No fasteners required; pure 3D-printed interlocking geometry.

* **Mechanism:** **Concentric infill pattern** in the roller ensures **smooth, consistent rotation** without grinding or wobble.

* **Speed:** Print all three components in **~1 hour 30 minutes** (under 2 hours total); each piece prints in under 8 minutes individually.

* **Function:** Fully functional **dough roller** suitable for cookies, pasta, and pastry work. Clean, smooth rotation thanks to optimized geometry.

## Assembly Instructions

**Print Order:** Dowel → Handles (x2) → Roller

1. **Print the Dowel first** (7m 35s) — this is your connector rod.
2. **Print the Handles** (two pieces, 7m 56s each or print both together) — these snap onto the dowel at opposite ends.
3. **Print the Roller** (1h 11m 27s) — the longest print; it slides over the dowel and rotates freely.

**Assembly Steps:**
1. After all three parts cool, inspect the snap-fit tabs on the handles and the dowel slots.
2. **Snap handles onto dowel:** Align the handles perpendicular to the dowel and press firmly until you hear/feel a click. Both handles should sit flush.
3. **Insert dowel into roller:** Slide the dowel assembly through the center bore of the roller. The roller should spin smoothly with no wobble.
4. **Test rotation:** Spin the roller by hand several times. Rotation should be smooth and consistent. If there's resistance, check for print artifacts (burrs) inside the roller bore and lightly sand if needed.

**Optional:** A tiny dab of super glue on the handle snap-fit joints can lock them in place if they feel loose after assembly.

## Critical Printing Notes

* **Roller Infill is Critical:** Use **concentric infill pattern** (NOT standard grid infill) for the roller component. This eliminates internal stress points and ensures smooth rotation without binding.

* **Z-Seam Placement:** Set to **random** for all components to distribute the seam evenly and prevent catching during rotation.

* **First-Layer Adhesion:** Ensure a **clean, level first layer** for all components. The roller's bore diameter tolerances depend on consistent first-layer height.

* **Snap-Fit Tolerances:** Handles snap into the dowel with precision geometry. If they're too tight, lightly sand the contact surfaces with 220-grit sandpaper. If too loose, a tiny dab of super glue works.

* **Rotation Test Before Use:** After assembly, spin the roller by hand 10–15 times to verify smooth, wobble-free rotation. Any grinding noise or stiffness indicates print quality issues (usually internal layer adhesion in the roller).

* **Material Choice:** Both **PLA and PETG work well**. PETG offers slightly better durability for heavy kneading. PLA is faster to print and requires no bed heat.
