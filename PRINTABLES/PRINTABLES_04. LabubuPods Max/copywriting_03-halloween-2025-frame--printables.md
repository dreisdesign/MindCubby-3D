### Title

Snap-Frame: Modular 3D Halloween Display

### Summary (120 characters max)

Snap-in modular frame system for Halloween figures. Interchangeable, rotatable, and perfect for easy multicolor prints.

### Description

Design, Function, and Customization

This is the MindCubby Snap-Frame, a modular framing system designed for creating custom 3D scenes on your desk or shelf. This initial release features a fun, spooky Halloween Ghost scene with two unique figures (one large, one small).

The system is engineered for customization and color:

* Modular Assembly: The frame and art pieces are printed separately. This design choice enables easy, multi-color printing (e.g., a black frame with white ghosts) without needing a multi-material system, simplifying the creation of eye-catching displays.  
* Interchangeable Art: The 3D figures feature robust snap-fit tabs that click securely into the frame's slots. This allows you to quickly mix, match, and swap out different art pieces as new scenes are released.  
* Rotatable Poses: You can rotate the installed art pieces 180∘ to change their perspective or pose instantly.

Print Tips & Settings  
The entire set is designed for simple printing with NO supports required on any component.  
Assembly: Simply align the tabs of the art piece with the slots in the frame and press until the piece is securely seated.

Tolerance: The snap-fit mechanism relies on tight tolerances. If your figures fit too loosely or too tightly, a minor adjustment (±0.05mm) to your Horizontal Expansion setting in your slicer is the ideal way to fine-tune the snap.
