This is my original design for Miniature Over-Ear Headphones,
specifically scaled to be the perfect accessory for collectible figures like
Labubu, Pop Mart, and other 1/12-scale art toys. The unique print-
in-place construction means no assembly is required—just pop them off
the plate, and they're ready to wear. The design features a hidden snap-
fit pivot that creates a highly satisfying click/snap rotation in the
earcups, making them fun to fidget with and pose.
Print Tips for the Perfect Snap
•
•
•
To ensure the print-in-place mechanism works smoothly and you get
the satisfying "snap," do not use supports and ensure your
printer's first layer adhesion is dialed in.
Tolerance: The hinge mechanism uses an engineered tolerance, so
a well-calibrated printer is essential.
Layer Separation: Gently rotate the hinges after the print is
complete to break the thin layer of adhesion. You will hear the
satisfying snap when the hinge is released!
