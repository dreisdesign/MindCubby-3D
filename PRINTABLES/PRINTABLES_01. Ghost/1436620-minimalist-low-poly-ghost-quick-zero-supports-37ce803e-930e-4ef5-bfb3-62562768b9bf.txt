Design, Function, and Customization
This is the MindCubby Snap-Frame, a modular framing system
designed for creating custom 3D scenes on your desk or shelf. This initial
release features a fun, spooky Halloween Ghost scene with two unique
figures (one large, one small).
The system is engineered for customization and color:
•
•
•
Modular Assembly: The frame and art pieces are printed
separately. This design choice enables easy, multi-color printing
(e.g., a black frame with white ghosts) without needing a multi-
material system, simplifying the creation of eye-catching displays.
Interchangeable Art: The 3D figures feature robust snap-fit tabs
that click securely into the frame's slots. This allows you to quickly
mix, match, and swap out different art pieces as new scenes are
released.
Rotatable Poses: You can rotate the installed art pieces 180∘ to
change their perspective or pose instantly.
Print Tips & Settings
The entire set is designed for simple printing with NO supports required
on any component.
Assembly: Simply align the tabs of the art piece with the slots in the
frame and press until the piece is securely seated.
Tolerance: The snap-fit mechanism relies on tight tolerances. If your
figures fit too loosely or too tightly, a minor adjustment (±0.05mm) to your
Horizontal Expansion setting in your slicer is the ideal way to fine-tune the
snap.
